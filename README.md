## Project Overview
This project aims to create an options pricing model using the Black-Scholes model and integrate it with React UI. This takes the inputs of the formula - current stock price of hte security and the strike price of the security, the risk free rate, volatility of the stock price, time to maturity (in years), and the option type - call or put. The model then returns the price of the option based on the inputs provided.
